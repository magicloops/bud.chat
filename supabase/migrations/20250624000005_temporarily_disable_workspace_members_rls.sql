-- Temporarily disable RLS on workspace_members to break infinite recursion
-- This is a quick fix since you're the workspace owner anyway

-- Keep workspaces RLS enabled but simplify the policy

-- Note: This temporarily reduces security but gets the app working
-- Since workspace_members RLS is disabled, all authenticated users can read/write to it
-- This is acceptable for development/single-user scenarios
