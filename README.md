bud.chat

Branch-first LLM chat for the web with a unified, providerâ€‘agnostic event model, streamingâ€‘first UX, and Supabase persistence. The app is now modularized into internal packages for events, models, providers, streaming, and data access.

**Key ideas**
- Branching conversations from any point using unified events
- Streamingâ€‘first: server emits SSE; client incrementally assembles/render events
- Providerâ€‘agnostic core; OpenAI and Anthropic adapters behind a single interface
- Supabase for auth and storage of conversations and events

**Design docs**
- Modularization plan: `design/modularization-plan.md`

Packages
- `@budchat/events` â€” Canonical Event/Segment types, EventLog, conversions, SSE envelope. See `packages/events/README.md`.
- `@budchat/models` â€” Friendlyâ†’API model mapping, provider detection, capability helpers. See `packages/models/README.md`.
- `@budchat/providers` â€” Unified provider layer (OpenAI Chat/Responses, Anthropic) with streaming. See `packages/providers/README.md`.
- `@budchat/streaming` â€” EventBuilder, rendering helpers, SSE processing (server/client). See `packages/streaming/README.md`.
- `@budchat/data` â€” Supabase repositories for conversations and events. See `packages/data/README.md`.

```

Getting started
- Use pnpm: `pnpm install`
- Env: copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill provider keys
- Run dev server: `pnpm run dev`

Notes
- Always use pnpm for scripts and installs.
- Model selection and provider routing are centralized in `@budchat/models`.
- The app code depends on the internal packages above; each packageâ€™s README documents its surface area.
