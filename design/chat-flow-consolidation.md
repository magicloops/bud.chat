# Chat Flow Consolidation Design Document

## Problem Statement

There are currently two different chat flows with inconsistent behavior:

1. **`/chat/new`** - New conversation flow (local state + API call)
2. **`/chat/[id]`** - Existing conversation flow (store state + API call)

**Key Issue**: Tool call handling differs between these flows, causing:
- `/chat/[id]` correctly creates separate events for tool calls and responses (matches DB structure)  
- `/chat/new` incorrectly appends tool calls to the end of messages and merges assistant responses

## Current Architecture

### `/chat/new` Flow (Optimistic UX)
```
User Input → Optimistic Local Events → Immediate Streaming → Background Conversation Creation → Seamless URL Transition
```
- **Key Feature**: Streaming starts immediately with optimistic events
- **UX Benefit**: No loading states or delays for first message
- **Transition**: Seamlessly moves to `/chat/[id]` once conversation is created

### `/chat/[id]` Flow (Store-based)
```
User Input → Store State → Optimistic Store Events → Response Streaming → Store Updates
```
- **Key Feature**: Leverages persistent conversation state
- **UX Benefit**: Consistent behavior for ongoing conversations

## Root Cause Analysis

The divergence occurs in multiple places:

1. **Frontend Event Handling**: Different streaming logic in EventStream component
2. **API Endpoints**: Different streaming implementations (`/api/chat-new` vs `/api/chat/[conversationId]`)  
3. **State Management**: Local state vs Zustand store handling
4. **Event Creation**: Different event creation patterns

## Critical Design Considerations

### Must Preserve: Optimistic UX Patterns

1. **Immediate Streaming Response**
   - User sees assistant response start streaming immediately after hitting send
   - No loading states or "creating conversation" delays
   - Conversation creation happens in background without blocking UX

2. **Seamless URL Transition**  
   - `/chat/new` → `/chat/[id]` transition happens without re-renders
   - User maintains context and sees continuous streaming
   - Browser history updated smoothly

3. **Optimistic Event Management**
   - Events created immediately in local state before API confirmation
   - Streaming updates happen on optimistic events
   - Error handling gracefully removes optimistic state

4. **State Consistency**
   - Local optimistic state must exactly match final store state
   - No flashing or content jumps during transitions
   - Event IDs and structure must be predictable

### Must Preserve: Performance Characteristics

1. **Minimal Re-renders** 
   - Event updates shouldn't cause cascading re-renders
   - State updates should be surgical and targeted
   - Component memoization patterns must be maintained

2. **Memory Management**
   - Local state cleaned up after successful transition
   - No memory leaks from dual state management
   - Efficient cleanup of streaming connections

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Consolidate Backend Streaming Logic

**Goal**: Both API endpoints use identical streaming logic

#### 1.1 Extract Shared Streaming Handler
Create `/lib/streaming/chatStreamHandler.ts`:

```typescript
export class ChatStreamHandler {
  constructor(
    private eventBuilder: EventStreamBuilder,
    private eventLog: EventLog,
    private controller: ReadableStreamDefaultController,
    private encoder: TextEncoder
  ) {}

  async handleAnthropicStream(stream: AnthropicStream) {
    // Unified streaming logic for both endpoints
  }

  async handleOpenAIStream(stream: OpenAIStream) {
    // Unified streaming logic for both endpoints  
  }

  private streamEvent(eventData: StreamEvent) {
    // Unified event streaming
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Extract Shared Tool Execution
Create `/lib/tools/mcpToolExecutor.ts`:

```typescript
export class MCPToolExecutor {
  async executeToolCalls(
    toolCalls: ToolCall[],
    workspaceId: string,
    budId?: string
  ): Promise<ToolResult[]> {
    // Unified MCP tool execution logic
  }
}
```

#### 1.3 Update API Endpoints
Both `/api/chat-new/route.ts` and `/api/chat/[conversationId]/route.ts` should:

```typescript
const streamHandler = new ChatStreamHandler(eventBuilder, eventLog, controller, encoder);
const toolExecutor = new MCPToolExecutor();

// Identical streaming logic
if (isClaudeModel(apiModelName)) {
  await streamHandler.handleAnthropicStream(stream);
} else {
  await streamHandler.handleOpenAIStream(stream);  
}
```

### Phase 2: Consolidate Frontend Event Handling

**Goal**: Both chat flows use identical event streaming logic

#### 2.1 Extract Shared Event Stream Logic
Create `/lib/streaming/frontendEventHandler.ts`:

```typescript
export class FrontendEventHandler {
  constructor(
    private conversationId: string,
    private store: EventChatStore
  ) {}

  async processStreamingResponse(response: Response) {
    // Unified frontend streaming logic
    // Handles: token, tool_start, tool_finalized, tool_result, tool_complete, complete, error
  }

  private handleTokenEvent(data: TokenEvent) {
    // Unified token handling logic
  }

  private handleToolEvents(data: ToolEvent) {
    // Unified tool event handling logic  
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Update EventStream Component
Refactor `EventStream.tsx` to preserve optimistic UX while using shared handler:

```typescript
// For /chat/new (optimistic flow)
const handleSendMessageNew = async (content: string) => {
  // 1. Create optimistic events immediately
  const userEvent = EventFactory.createUserEvent(content);
  const assistantPlaceholder = EventFactory.createAssistantPlaceholder();
  
  // 2. Update local state immediately (no delays)
  setLocalEvents([...events, userEvent, assistantPlaceholder]);
  
  // 3. Start streaming to local state immediately
  const eventHandler = new FrontendEventHandler(null, null); // No store yet
  eventHandler.setLocalStateUpdater(setLocalEvents);
  
  // 4. Send request and start streaming (no await - parallel)
  const responsePromise = fetch('/api/chat-new', requestConfig);
  
  // 5. Process streaming response to local state
  const response = await responsePromise;
  await eventHandler.processStreamingResponse(response);
  
  // 6. On conversation created, seamlessly transition to store
  if (response.conversationId) {
    transferLocalStateToStore(response.conversationId);
    router.replace(`/chat/${response.conversationId}`);
  }
};

// For /chat/[id] (store-based flow)  
const handleSendMessageExisting = async (content: string) => {
  // Use identical optimistic + streaming pattern, but with store
  const eventHandler = new FrontendEventHandler(conversationId, store);
  
  // Same optimistic events, same streaming logic
  await eventHandler.handleOptimisticMessage(content);
};
```

#### 2.3 Preserve Seamless Transition Logic
Create `/lib/optimistic/stateTransition.ts`:

```typescript
export class OptimisticStateManager {
  // Transfer local events to store without re-renders
  transferToStore(conversationId: string, localEvents: Event[]): void {
    // Ensure event IDs and structure match exactly
    // Update store state atomically
    // Clear local state after successful transfer
  }
  
  // Handle streaming updates during transition period
  handleTransitionUpdates(eventId: string, update: EventUpdate): void {
    // Update both local and store state during transition
    // Ensure consistency across state boundaries
  }
}

### Phase 3: Unify State Management Patterns

**Goal**: Consistent event creation and state updates

#### 3.1 Standardize Event Creation
Create `/lib/events/eventFactory.ts`:

```typescript
export class EventFactory {
  static createUserEvent(content: string): Event {
    // Standardized user event creation
  }
  
  static createAssistantPlaceholder(): Event {
    // Standardized assistant placeholder creation
  }
  
  static createToolResultEvent(toolId: string, output: any): Event {
    // Standardized tool result event creation
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Standardize State Updates
Ensure both flows use identical state update patterns:

```typescript
// Same optimistic updates
// Same streaming event updates  
// Same event finalization
// Same error handling
```
