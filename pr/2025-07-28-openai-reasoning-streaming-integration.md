# OpenAI Reasoning Streaming Integration

**Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Type**: Feature Implementation  
**Impact**: High - Major new feature for o-series model reasoning visibility

## Overview

Implements comprehensive streaming support for OpenAI's Responses API reasoning tokens, enabling real-time display of o-series model (o1, o3, o3-mini, o4-mini) internal reasoning process during chat conversations.

## Problem

OpenAI's new o-series models perform sophisticated internal reasoning before generating responses, but this reasoning process was invisible to users. The new Responses API exposes this through streaming reasoning summaries, which needed to be:

- ✅ Captured from OpenAI's Responses API
- ✅ Streamed in real-time to the frontend  
- ✅ Persisted to database for historical access
- ✅ Displayed in an intuitive, collapsible UI
- ✅ Handled correctly across page refreshes

## Solution

### 📡 **OpenAI Responses API Integration**

**New File**: `lib/providers/openaiResponses.ts`
- Handles transformation of OpenAI reasoning events to internal format
- Supports all reasoning event types (`reasoning_summary_*`)
- Processes streaming reasoning parts and completion events
- Creates OpenAI Responses API requests with reasoning effort configuration

### 🗄️ **Database Integration**

**Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250726000001_add_reasoning_to_events.sql`
- Added `reasoning` JSONB column to events table
- Optimized with GIN and partial indexes for reasoning queries
- Stores structured reasoning data with parts, combined text, and metadata

**Enhanced**: `@budchat/data`
- All event saving functions now preserve reasoning data
- Database persistence works across both new and existing chat routes

### 🎯 **Event System Enhancement**

**Enhanced**: `lib/types/events.ts`
- Added `ReasoningData` and `ReasoningPart` interfaces
- Events now include optional reasoning data
- Supports multi-part reasoning with indexing and streaming states

**Enhanced**: `lib/streaming/eventBuilder.ts`
- EventStreamBuilder now supports reasoning data attachment
- Proper finalization of events with reasoning information

**Enhanced**: `lib/streaming/frontendEventHandler.ts`
- Added reasoning-specific event types to StreamEvent interface
- Handles reasoning event streaming and state management

### 🎨 **UI Implementation**

**Enhanced**: `components/EventList/EventItem.tsx`
- **Smart Auto-Expand**: Reasoning shows automatically while streaming, collapses when complete
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Reasoning appears above assistant response (thinking → response flow)
- **Loading States**: Animated spinner during reasoning streaming
- **Effort Level Display**: Shows reasoning effort level (low/medium/high) as badge
- **Collapsible Toggle**: Manual toggle for completed reasoning sections
- **Multi-part Support**: Displays individual reasoning parts during streaming

### 🔧 **Model Configuration**

**Enhanced**: `lib/modelMapping.ts`
- Added o3, o3-mini, o4-mini model definitions
- Enhanced model detection for reasoning-capable models
- Added reasoning effort support detection

**Enhanced**: `components/BudForm.tsx` & `components/settings-panel.tsx`
- Added reasoning effort configuration (low/medium/high)
- UI controls for o-series model reasoning settings

### 🐛 **Critical Fixes Implemented**

1. **Database Persistence**: Fixed reasoning data not saving to database after page refresh
2. **UI Ordering**: Moved reasoning display above assistant content (logical flow)
3. **Streaming Completion**: Implemented frontend-only completion detection (OpenAI doesn't send completion events for o3)
4. **Route Consistency**: Ensured reasoning works identically in both new chat and existing conversation routes
5. **Loading State**: Fixed infinite reasoning spinner through frontend-based completion detection
6. **State Management**: Prevented infinite re-renders in React streaming components

## Key Features

### 🚀 **Real-time Reasoning Display**
- Reasoning streams in real-time as the model thinks
- Automatically expands during streaming, collapses when complete
- Shows individual reasoning parts as they arrive
- Combines parts into coherent reasoning summary

### 💾 **Complete Persistence**
- All reasoning data saved to database with JSONB structure
- Reasoning available after page refresh and conversation navigation
- Optimized database queries with proper indexes

### 🎛️ **Configurable Reasoning Effort**
- Support for low/medium/high reasoning effort levels
- Configurable per-bud for different use cases
- Affects model reasoning depth and token usage

### 🔄 **Frontend-Only Completion Detection**
```typescript
// Smart completion detection since OpenAI doesn't send completion events
const isReasoningStreaming = hasReasoning && !hasTextContent;
const shouldShowReasoning = isReasoningStreaming || showReasoning;
```
